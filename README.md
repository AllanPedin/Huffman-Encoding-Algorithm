# Huffman-Encoding-Algorithm
An r-ary Huffman Encoding Algorithm.

# Project Description
An r-ary Huffman Encoding Algorithm. In the programming language of your
choice, create a command that takes two inputs: a radix r and a probability distribution
{p1, . . . , pq} given as an ordered list. Assume that the corresponding source alphabet is
simply {s1, . . . , sq}. Your command should output an r-ary Huffman encoding scheme
for a source with the given probability distribution. It is at your discretion how to
present that output, but it should be easily readable. You should follow the algorithm
detailed in Exercise 2.2.11 in the textbook. (You may use the provided solution in the
text to help you.)

Fine print:
 - You will present your work by emailing a copy of your code to Dr. Fogarty by the
deadline. You will later explain and demonstrate your code, either in his office
or remotely, using a number of test cases. Dr. Fogarty will make the test cases
available to you in advance, if you ask him nicely.
 -  You should not use pre-existing packages in writing your program.
 -  You are not responsible for creating error messages for improper inputs. You may
also assume that r, q â‰¥ 2.
